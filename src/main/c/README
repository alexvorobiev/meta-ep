meta is the primary test vehicle right now.

current experiments in the code are

  convergence acceleration methods
meta evolution
directed evolution
recorded step

  general techniques
meta-mutation of crossover strategy

  diversity maintenance
speciation controls


so far, the convergence acceleration methods are too good for highly
multi-modal problems such as some of the iceo contest problems but
they work very well on problems with very local rugosity and narrow
valleys.

speciation has problems with degeneracy.  the goal is to avoid
starving secondary solutions of resources before they have had time to
sufficiently explore their neighborhoods.  especially when convergence
acceleration is being used, a dominant solution can appear early and
become so successful that other potential solutions are crowded out
and eventually go extinct.  two quick solutions are to retain lineage
information and either limit the maximum number of solutions from a
single lineage, or require that a minimum number of solutions from
each lineage survive.  unfortunately, lineages often converge on the
same solution which makes it appear desirable to do some sort of
clustering to merge lineages (and create novel ones) when populations
intrude on each other's territory.  how to do this is not clear.
